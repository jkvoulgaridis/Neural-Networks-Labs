# Neural-Networks-Labs

This repository contains every lab projects that needed to be completed for the course of Neural Networks @NTUA, Gr, winter semester 2020-2021. 

## Lab1 - Supervised Learning

Given two famous datasets of the UCI Machine Learning Repository and in particular : Connectionist Bench (Sonar, Mines vs. Rocks), Statlog (Landsat Satellite) our goal was to maximize a given metric (f1_macro or/and f1_micro) by choosing the optimal model out of all well known supervised algorithms and by optimising the optimal values for the crusial hyperparameters. 

## Lab2 - Unsupervised Learning in Carnegie Mellon Movie Summary Corpus

1) Given a large Dataset containing various film titles along with their corresponding summary, the goal to creaate to build a content based  recommender system usind tfIdfVectorisation (applied on the summary corpus).
2) The next task was to train a SOM such tha relative movie genres are mapped near to each other. 

## Lab3 - Deep Learning in Ciphar 100 using TensorFlow.
